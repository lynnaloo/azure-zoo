# Azure Zoo

Take an exciting journey through the Azure Zoo, where we'll explore the fascinating world of Azure Integration Services.

## Azure Services

* Azure Service Bus: Use this for reliable messaging between different parts of the system. For example, when a visitor purchases a ticket online, a message is sent to the visitor management system.
* Azure Event Grid: Implement event-driven architecture to handle events such as ticket purchases, animal feeding times, and exhibit updates. This allows different services to react to these events in real-time.
* Azure API Management: Manage and secure APIs that expose functionalities such as ticket booking, exhibit information, and visitor feedback to external systems, such as mobile apps or partner services.
* Azure Logic Apps: Automate workflows, such as sending ticket confirmation emails, updating exhibit information, and notifying visitors about special events or feeding times.
* Azure Functions: Use serverless functions to handle specific tasks, like calculating visitor capacity or generating personalized recommendations for exhibits based on visitor preferences.

## Integration Flow

* Ticket Purchase: A visitor purchases a ticket through a web or mobile app, which sends a message to Azure Service Bus.
* Visitor Management: The visitor management system picks up the message and processes the ticket purchase. This includes checking visitor capacity, generating a digital ticket, and updating the visitor count.
* Event Handling: Azure Event Grid triggers events for ticket purchases, animal feeding times, and exhibit updates. These events are handled by various services, such as updating exhibit information and notifying visitors about special events.
* API Management: Expose APIs for ticket booking, exhibit information, and visitor feedback, allowing visitors to access real-time information and provide feedback through mobile apps.
* Automation: Use Azure Logic Apps to automate tasks like sending ticket confirmation emails, updating exhibit information, and notifying visitors about special events or feeding times.
