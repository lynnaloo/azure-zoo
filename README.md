# Azure Zoo

Take an exciting journey through the Azure Zoo, where we'll explore the fascinating world of Azure Integration Services.

## Azure Services

* Azure Service Bus: Use this for reliable messaging between different parts of the system. For example, when a visitor purchases a ticket online, a message is sent to the visitor management system.
* Azure Event Grid: Implement event-driven architecture to handle events such as ticket purchases, animal feeding times, and exhibit updates. This allows different services to react to these events in real-time.
* Azure API Management: Manage and secure APIs that expose functionalities such as ticket booking, exhibit information, and visitor feedback to external systems, such as mobile apps or partner services.
* Azure Logic Apps: Automate workflows, such as sending ticket confirmation emails, updating exhibit information, and notifying visitors about special events or feeding times.
* Azure Functions: Use serverless functions to handle specific tasks, like calculating visitor capacity or generating personalized recommendations for exhibits based on visitor preferences.
